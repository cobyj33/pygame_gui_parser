Contributing
=======================

| When I first started working with pygame, I noticed how there was really no "good" way to handle GUI work.
| I knew it was completely possible (shoutout `DaFluffyPotato, everyone's pygame inspiration <https://www.youtube.com/@DaFluffyPotato>`_) from what I've seen from a few standout creators, but I was really surprised to see there no even de_facto framework for creating GUI's in a game library


There are only a few guidelines to contributing
- Everything must be well documented
- All old tests should still pass, as well as valid new tests should be added for the new features
- It would be preferred if an issue was opened with a recommendation before creating a pull request
- Try to keep code following the PEP8 style guidelines if possible
- Docstrings on functions and classes ( unless that function or class is extremely self explanatory like add_two_integers or something ) 
- Don't limit yourself to contributing just code, contributing examples, documentation, or answers to other questions are equally as important (if not more)
- See above ^^^^^^^^^^^ I'd love to see other's using the library for their own projects, and its the best way to find new functionality that we'd like to add

But to be honest, any contribution is valued, these are just recommendations (at the end of the day, I do still decide what gets merged o not though)
