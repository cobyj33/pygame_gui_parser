Welcome to pygame_gui_xml's documentation!
==========================================

pygame_gui_xml is a python package made for ease of use of the pygame_gui user interfaces

| The main goal with pygame_gui_xml was to remove the imperative, inflexible case of writing GUI's directly in code. An abstraction upon an abstraction
| However, obviously an abstraction is only useful if it actually makes one's goal easier to get for
| For that reason, pygame_gui_xml is inspired off of the web model of **HTML, CSS, and JS**, as I hope it's layout should be very familiar to anyone who has developed for the web
| I hope that you can find this package useful to your needs, and if not, feel free to comment and share an issue on github or email me at jacobyajohnson@gmail.com with any concerns or improvements
